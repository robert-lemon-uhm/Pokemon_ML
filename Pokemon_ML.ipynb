In the video games, each pokemon has one or two types, as well as 6 attribute stats. There are a total of 18 possible types (see list below), and each pokemon has a primary typing, and might also have a secondary typing. The 6 stats are HP (health), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

If we are able to confidently predict a pokemon's type, then the models have discovered a learnable pattern between types and stats. If not, then the game of Pokemon is fairly well-balanced, avoiding certain typings to have either dominating or underpowered stats.

As we are trying to predict the primary type of a pokemon based on its stats, the accuracy of our predictions is a rather self-explanatory metric for basic performance. Since there are 18 different types, randomly guessing a pokemon's type would have a 1/18 chance of being correct, or an accuracy of ~5.5%.\n","\n","However, that performance is solely based on hard predictions. Most models used (with the exception of K Means, as it is unsupervised) can generate probabilistic predictions though, which show the probability of an example corresponding to each individual label. In order to evaluate the performance of a model's probabilistic predictions, the AUROC (area under ROC curve) metric is used. An AUROC value of 0.5 corresponds to randomly guessing, and 1.0 indicates a perfect model.

This model was included to see if a significant improvement from a single decision tree could be achieved.\n","\n","* **K-Nearest Neighbors:** Our classification problem has 18 distinct labels that we are trying to properly assign new pokemon to, so we can place each example in high dimensional space (6D, as each stat is used as a dimension) and choose its label based on the labels of its closest neighbors. This model should be significantly better than a single decision tree.\n","\n","* **K-Means:** Classification problems with known labels often lend themselves to supervised learning, but this unsupervised clusering model was included to demonstrate the difference in performance betweeen supervised and unsupervised learning on a problem such as this.

However, if the separation between clusters is less obvious, you would not expect good performance.\n","\n","* **Sequential Neural Network:** Neural networks can be tricky with such a small dataset, more specifically loss optimization and global minimum detection.

Because of this, it was relatively easy to perform most of the hyperparameter tuning by hand. Most models had minimal hyperparameters to begin with, which further simplified this process. The specific tunings are stated below:\n","\n","* **Decision Tree / Random Forest:** The max depth of the decision tree and random forest was set at 10, as leaving it unbounded seemed to cause slight overfitting. The number of trees in the random forest model was set to 50, as any extra didn't seem to improve performance.\n","\n","* **K-Nearest Neighbors:** The k value of a K-Nearest Neighbors model should typically be roughly the square root of your input size. The training dataset consisted of 674 examples, so the k value was set to 26 (`sqrt(674) = 25.9`). Decreasing this k value strictly lowered both performance metrics, and increasing the k value had inconsistent effects, so I ended up using 26 for the final value.\n","\n","* **K-Means:** Since there are 18 unique labels for this data, it wouldn't make sense to use any other k value for the K-Means model. Ideally, each cluster would represent a single type.\n","\n","* **Sequential Neural Network:** This model was comprised of a few dense layers, gradually increasing the number of units in each layer until it reached the number of output labels (6, then 12, then 18). Each of these layers used relu activation, as I found that this works best for classification problems such as this one. A final softmax layer was used for the output, which is fairly standard. The model used categorical cross entropy loss, since there are 18 possible labels for categorization. Stochastic gradient descent was the best performing optimizer, although it still had trouble finding the global minimum.

It was more challenging than expected to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss of this model between epochs, which could indicate many local minimums.

These results indicate the presence of a slight learnable pattern between a pokemon's stats and their primary typing, but not enough to confidently classify pokemon using a simple machine learning model. It could still be possible to more accurately predict typing based on stats alone, but I believe further feature engineering and a more complex model would be needed (see ***Possible Improvements***).\n","\n","While these results might be underwhelming or disappointing, they are an indication that the Pokemon video games are fairly well-balanced when it comes to typings.

While this would typically lead to overfitting towards the test set, I was not using these evaluations to tune hyperparameters (I re-permuted the data each time I tuned hyperparameters to avoid bias) or to pick a single best model to use. Since it became apparent that no obvious patter was going to arise from this dataset, I wanted to demonstrate how each model performed in relation to each other on this dataset, instead of trying to actually make confident predictions. In order to select a specific model and make more confident predictions, a validation set is needed. Split the dataset into a train, validate, and test set, use the training set to train all the models, the validation set to evaluate them, pick the best model, and perform the final evaluation on the held-out test set.\n","\n","2. **Restructure the Problem:** Since predicting a pokemon's type based on its stats proved less effective than anticipated, it might be interesting to try to use the stats to predict typing *given two or three choices*. If you know a pokemon is a fire type for instance, randomly choose another type, and see if the model can correctly choose between the two types. This could also be accomplished by combining all the examples of fire types and water types, then trying to sort them. \n","\n","3. **Utilize the secondary typing of some pokemon:** This project only looked at a pokemon's primary typing, even though some pokemon have a secondary type as well, and the data is available in the API.
